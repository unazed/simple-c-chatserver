# simple-c-chatserver

Serving more as a testament to my C programming capability--a simple implementation of a chatserver protocol from socket-level up.

`confclient.cc` contains sample client code and `confserver.cc` contains
the main server code. Build simply with `make`, tested with GCC 10.2.0.

P.S.: I realize the extension `.cc` is standardly for `C++` commands, and that the `Makefile` invokes `g++`, but that's to be disregarded.
